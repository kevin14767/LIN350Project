# LIN350Project - The Language of Immigration Politics: Terminology Differences Across Party Lines in Congressional Speeches

This research examines how party lines differ in their terminology when discussing immigration in Congressional speeches. By analyzing word frequencies, contextual patterns, and topic distributions, we investigate how language choices (such as "undocumented" versus "illegal") reflect broader political framing strategies and evolve over time.

## Research Questions

What statistically significant differences exist in the frequency of immigration-related terminology (e.g., "undocumented" vs. "illegal") between political parties?
How do these terminological choices correlate with specific policy positions or votes?
Has the terminology used by each party shifted over the past decade (2015-2025) or what about (1970-2025)?, and if so, in what direction?
