# LIN350Project
This research examines how party lines differ in their terminology when discussing immigration in Congressional speeches. By analyzing word frequencies, contextual patterns, and topic distributions, we investigate how language choices (such as "undocumented" versus "illegal") reflect broader political framing strategies and evolve over time.
