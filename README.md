# LIN350Project - The Language of Immigration Politics: Terminology Differences Across Party Lines in Congressional Speeches

This research examines how party lines differ in their terminology when discussing immigration in Congressional speeches. By analyzing word frequencies, contextual patterns, and topic distributions, we investigate how language choices (such as "undocumented" versus "illegal") reflect broader political framing strategies and evolve over time.

## Motivation

## Research Questions

1. What statistically significant differences exist in the frequency of immigration-related terminology (e.g., “undocumented” vs. “illegal”) between Democratic and Republican representatives?

2. How has party-specific immigration terminology shifted during key political events between 2017 and 2021, such as the DACA debates, the 2018–2019 government shutdown, or early Biden-era policy reversals?

3. What contextual linguistic patterns (e.g., collocates, frames, sentiment) surround immigration terms in each party's discourse, and how do these reflect broader ideological narratives or legislative priorities?
