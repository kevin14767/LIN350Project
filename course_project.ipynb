      "distinguished career in public office, serving first in the Kansas \n",
      "House of Representatives, followed by multiple terms in the U.S. House \n",
      "of Representatives. In 1999, Dole was elected to the United States \n",
      "Senate, where he served for 27 years and rose to be majority leader \n",
      "before running for President.\n",
      "  Over the course of his political career, Senator Dole developed a \n",

      "public.\n",
      "  For example, in speaking about the importance of Social Security and \n",
      "the need to protect Medicare for America's senior citizens, Dole said \n",

      "  Although he was not elected President, as the nominee of the \n",

      "the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund, which raised more than $100 \n",
      "million for the educational needs of the families of victims of 9/11, \n",
      "and he served as the co-creator of the McGovern-Dole International Food \n",

      "  While Senator Dole and I have had our share of policy differences \n",
      "over the years, it was always possible to have a civil disagreement \n",

      "in a bipartisan way and ensured that these programs were strengthened \n",
      "so that we were making great progress toward ending hunger in America.\n",
      "  And then he joined with George McGovern in the formation of the \n",
      "McGovern-Dole International Food for Education Program. Essentially, \n",
      "this is a program that expands school feeding initiatives all around \n",
      "the world, and millions and millions and millions of children are not \n",

    "1. Immigration is a Consistently Polarizing Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "    The top divergent terms highlight persistent framing differences, even across years with different administrations. This supports the hypothesis that immigration remains a highly partisan issue in U.S. politics.\n",

    "2. Political Events Drive Terminology Spikes\n",
    "\n",
    "    Event annotations (e.g. Family Separation, Elections) align with notable spikes in specific term frequencies. This validates your method and emphasizes the role of external events in shaping political discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Normalized Frequencies Reveal Subtle Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "    By measuring per 1,000 tokens, your analysis captures rhetorical shifts even when overall speech volume changes, allowing for fair year-to-year comparisons."

    "Based on the visualizations of term usage from 2017–2021\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **“immigration”**\n",
    "- **Republican** usage peaked in 2018 (likely a response to the Family Separation policy), then dropped sharply through 2021.\n",
    "- **Democratic** usage declined steadily.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: The term “immigration” became less central after 2018, possibly replaced by more specific framing (e.g., “migrant” or “border”) or due to fatigue and shifting focus during COVID.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **“migrant”**\n",
    "- Consistent **Democratic** dominance in usage, with a steady decline.\n",
    "- **Republican** usage was always lower and declined similarly.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: “Migrant” is more common in humanitarian or individual-focused discourse, aligning with Democratic framing. Decreased usage over time could reflect reduced legislative attention or shifting terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **“border”**\n",
    "- Sharp **Republican** spike in 2019, aligning with the *Wall* and *caravan crisis* narratives.\n",
    "- Both parties saw major drops post-2019.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: “Border” surged with Trump-era policies and media focus but faded post-2020, possibly due to shifting public priorities and political strategy changes under Biden.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **“daca”**\n",
    "- Massive early **Democratic** emphasis (esp. 2017), tied to efforts to protect DACA recipients.\n",
    "- Near-zero usage from 2019 onward by both parties.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Declining mentions reflect stalled legislative movement and the issue becoming less central post-Trump.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **“mexico”**\n",
    "- Gradual **Republican** increase, overtaking Democrats by 2021.\n",
    "- 2020 spike from both parties, possibly linked to the “Remain in Mexico” policy or campaign rhetoric.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Republicans increasingly invoke “Mexico” in enforcement/geopolitical contexts; Democrats’ interest spiked in 2020 but declined post-election.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **“dreamer”**\n",
    "- Overwhelmingly a **Democratic** term in early years (2017–2018).\n",
    "- Usage collapsed by 2019.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: “Dreamer” reflects advocacy for undocumented youth. Declining mentions may reflect reduced legislative hope or strategic deprioritization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " Cross-Cutting Themes & Final Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Term Selection Reflects Party Priorities**\n",
    "- Democrats gravitate toward *people-centered* terms (“dreamer”, “migrant”, “daca”).\n",
    "- Republicans lean into *security and enforcement* terms (“border”, “immigration”, “mexico”).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **General Decline in Mentions**\n",
    "- Most terms declined after 2019, regardless of party.\n",
    "- This suggests:\n",
    "  - **Issue fatigue** or less policy activity.\n",
    "  - The dominance of **COVID-19** discourse starting in 2020.\n",
    "  - Fewer landmark immigration developments post-2019 until Title 42’s repeal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diminished Polarization by 2021**\n",
    "- In 2021, some terms converge in usage (e.g., “immigration” and “migrant”).\n",
    "- This may signal either bipartisan disengagement or a momentary cooling of public rhetoric under Biden.\n",

    "In-Depth Term Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1.. **“border”**\n",
    "Observed Trend:\n",
    "- Steady Republican usage in 2017–2018, with a **dramatic spike in 2019** (over 4 mentions per 1,000 tokens).\n",
    "- Democratic mentions also peaked in 2019 but at a lower level.\n",
    "- Sharp decline for both parties after 2019, stabilizing at low levels by 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "This term's prominence in 2019 aligns with several key political developments:\n",
    "- **Trump's National Emergency Declaration (Feb 2019)** to fund the border wall likely fueled Republican talking points centered on “border security.”\n",
    "- **Caravan migration narratives** dominated media cycles, especially on conservative outlets, influencing speech patterns.\n",
    "- Democrats also ramped up border-related discussions during this time — often in opposition, emphasizing humanitarian concerns or the implications of militarizing the border.\n",
    "\n",
    "Party Framing:\n",
    "- **Republicans:** “Border” was used as a symbol of national security and legal enforcement.\n",
    "- **Democrats:** Framed around human impact, with critiques of detention centers and border patrol practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **“dreamer”**\n",
    "Observed Trend:\n",
    "- Extremely high usage by Democrats in 2017–2018 (peaking around 3.8–4.0 per 1,000 tokens).\n",
    "- Virtually disappears after 2019.\n",
    "- Republicans used this term only sparingly throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "- The spike reflects intense Democratic advocacy following **Trump’s 2017 rescission of the DACA program**, which protected undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.\n",
    "- Democratic leaders pushed for the DREAM Act during 2017–2018, making “Dreamers” a centerpiece of their immigration messaging.\n",
    "- After **multiple failed legislative efforts** and **Supreme Court delays**, the term fell out of use, likely due to issue fatigue and legislative gridlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Party Framing:\n",
    "- **Democrats:** Framed “dreamers” as blameless, high-achieving young people who deserved permanent protection.\n",
    "- **Republicans:** Rarely invoked the term, possibly due to its **sympathetic connotation**, instead framing immigration more broadly around legality and borders.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **“immigration”**\n",
    "Observed Trend:\n",
    "- **Republican** usage peaked in 2018 (2.0 per 1,000 tokens), coinciding with national debates on enforcement.\n",
    "- **Democratic** mentions steadily declined over the years.\n",
    "- By 2021, both parties nearly converged at minimal usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "- The **2018 surge** ties directly to the **Family Separation policy**, which became a flashpoint in immigration discourse.\n",
    "- Republican usage often reflected defense or justification of harsher enforcement under the Trump administration.\n",
    "- As **COVID-19** and **economic concerns** rose post-2020, immigration lost attention in congressional discourse — explaining the universal drop in usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Party Framing:\n",
    "- **Republicans:** Focused on “immigration” as a security and law enforcement issue.\n",
    "- **Democrats:** Gradually de-emphasized the term itself in favor of more humanizing alternatives like “migrant,” “asylum,” or issue-specific terms like “DACA.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Thoughts\n",
    "These terms capture broader partisan strategies:\n",
    "- Republicans centered enforcement and sovereignty (e.g. “border”).\n",
    "- Democrats emphasized vulnerable populations and individual stories (e.g. “dreamer”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Their rises and falls in frequency are tightly coupled to real-world policy fights, executive actions, and moments of national attention — underscoring how **language mirrors power, policy, and public pressure**."
